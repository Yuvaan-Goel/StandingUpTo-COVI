				<h1>COVID pills</h1><br>
	<container>
	<p>Pills are oral treatments, which is a game changer for recovering against the virus quickly, that to at home. Two most effective COVID pills are: Pfizer's Paxlovid and Merck's Molnupiravir. Those two pills have been approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration), and have shown significant decline in hospitilizations. Remember to ask a doctor if COVID pills are advisable and also which one is right for you immediately after you test positive for the virus and have not yet been admitted to a hospital.</p><br><b>Merck's Molnupiravir</b><p>Molnupiravir is the first COVID antiviral pill that is in India, the rate being 35 Rupees per packet.
<br><br>
<b class="sub">Eligibility</b>
        <br> The antiviral pill is available for people who are: <br> 
        1. High risk for developing severe COVID<br>
        2. Age 18+<br>
        3. Have no other FDA authorized treatment or not appropriate for them
<br><br>
<b class="sub">How it Works</b>
        <br> Before learning how the pill works, you first need to know how the virus spreads around cells. Once COVID-19 enters your body's cells, it replicates its genomes, which is made out of RNA (stands for ribonucleic acid, and it is basically a long, single stranded chain of cells that processes). These genomes form into virus particles and burst out of the cell, then keep spreading around your body. But, the molnupiravir pill molecules absorbs these cells and convert them into a defective version, so now the virus can't replicate because of having defective genetic material. It is shown to reduce COVID hospitalizations by 30%.
<br><br>
<b class="sub">How it is Taken</b>
        <br> Molnupiravir is administered by taking 4 tablets every 12 hours, every 5 days.
<br><br>
<b class="sub">Side Effects</b>
        <br> After taking the pills, you may experience: <br> 
        1. Diarrhea<br>
        2. Nausea<br>

        1. High risk for developing severe COVID<br>
        2. Age 12+ (atleast 88 pounds, or about 39.1 kg)
<br><br>
<b class="sub">How it is Taken</b>
<br> Paxlovid is administered by taking 2 tablets of nirmatrelvir and 1 tablet of ritonavir to be taken together  twice every day for five days.
<br><br>
<b class="sub">How it Works</b>
        <br> The nirmatrelvir inactivates the enzyme which makes the virus duplicate itself, while the ritonavir helps the nirmatrelvir to not break down during the process. It is shown to reduce COVID hospitalizations by 89%.
